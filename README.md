# Local Library Django Application

This Django application is designed for local librarians to manage their library's catalog, including viewing books borrowed by users and managing book statuses.

## Overview

For this Library Django application, I developed a catalog to be used by local librarians to view the different books borrowed by the users of the system. The administrator can access the author, create, and borrowed books views, and can also renew the status of a book on loan.

This project provided me with an overview of implementing class-based views (CBVs) and function-based views (FBVs). With CBVs, we write less code for a particular functionality, making our code more readable and manageable by the team.

## Structure

The project structure follows Django's conventions, with key components including:

- **Models**: Define the data structure using Django models.
- **Views**: Implement logic for handling HTTP requests and returning appropriate responses.
- **Templates**: Create HTML templates for rendering the user interface.
- **Forms**: Build forms for user input validation and data submission.
- **URLs**: Configure URL patterns to map to views.
- **Admin Interface**: Utilize Django's built-in admin interface for managing site content.
